# Execution Plan: Test agatchi

## Overview
ultrathink. I want to build an app for the iphone with an apple watch counterpart that is like an ai smart tamagatchi. come up with a comprehensive implementation plan and issues to tackle this complex project. we should try to use a small ai model that can be run on the phone. basic interaction from the tamagotchi's or nano pets of old should exist like feeding napping etc. They should build a context and relationship with the user that builds over time.
